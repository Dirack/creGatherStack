### Scripts used in deploy stage of a new version

Scripts in the deploy directory builds template files with '.deploy'
suffix. Travis CI calls these scripts during deploy stage  and stores
the generated files in a draft release to be published.

- build_release_message.sh: generates a release description
with relevant commits it gets from history. It uses marks in the
commit subject (described in the script header) to filter relevant
commits and group them in sections on the release description
based on this marks in a tag.deploy file. The marks used by this
script are as follows (Use them if you want a commit in the release
history and CHANGELOG).

  - [CHA] Changed for changes in existing functionality.
  - [DEP] Deprecated for once-stable features removed in upcoming releases.
  - [REM] Removed for deprecated features removed in this release.
  - [FIX] Fixed for any bug fixes.
  - [SEC] Security to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities.

- build_changelog_update.sh: uses the file generated by the
previous script to update the CHANGELOG, it generates a template file
CHANGELOG.deploy with updated CHANGELOG.

- build_dockerfile.sh: generates the Dockerfile to be
used to generate a docker package of this repository current version. The
Dockerfile is stored in a template file, Dockerfile.deploy.
